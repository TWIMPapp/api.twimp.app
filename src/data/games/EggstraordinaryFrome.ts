Safety is obviously paramount, the real world has real dangers. Whilst this is an app and will require your attention from time to time, you don't need to look at your device the whole time, in fact we encourage you not to.

Any time there's a predictable danger that our creators noticed whilst creating the story, we will use these Storyteller screens to let you know but we can't predict everything so please remain vigilant throughout.

Also, just to let you know, the trail is basically a loop so will bring you back to Victoria Park.

Right, let's get on with the story shall we, over to you Easter Bunny.

Have you ever wondered why Easter Egg hunts that I've set out aren't completely melted by the time that you go out to find them? Well, I have a little secret, they're digitised! Sometimes I set out the Easter Egg Hunts the night before, I place the eggs down, digitise them in place and then set a timer. And when that timer goes off, they turn back into chocolate, just in time for your hunt! Clever huh!?

Well I set out a whole bunch last night and by this morning, they were gone, someone stole them! In a few minutes they will turn back into chocolate and then they'll be gone for good. I need to find out who is doing this and stop them before they ruin any more Easter Egg Hunts.

One time, we had a problem with The Grinch interfering with Easter in Bristol but that's another story.

Anyway, inside this one is a digitiser. It's used in emergencies like this one where something is due to appear where it shouldn't, when it shouldn't. If you activate it, it will send out a signal to any digitised items in the city. When the signal bounces back, we will also know roughly where the eggs are and we can go collect them.

I just need to enter the 4 digit pin to activate it. I can't remember what the code is but it should be written somewhere in plain sight in or around the statue.

Something is going on here and I don't like it. I'm going to pop back to where my eggs were stolen and see if I can find some clues of my own. I've put a pin on your map where the nearest egg should be, speak to you when you get there.

Just to let you know, you're approaching a very busy road and this clue will take you close to it so please be careful.

At no point should you need to cross the busy road.  There's one more egg to find in the town centre so if you're in need of refreshment, after this one or the next is probably a good time.

If you do go somewhere, please share where you go with us on our Facebook page.  Maybe next year we can get some discounts for you! :)
