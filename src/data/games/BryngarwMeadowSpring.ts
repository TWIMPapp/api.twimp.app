But today, I come to you not just as a bee, but as a bearer of tales from a time long past, when this park was not the lush haven you see before you.\n\nOnce upon a time, Bryngarw Park was a realm in need of guardianship. Its rivers ran dark with the stains of industry, its meadows marred by neglect, and its woodlands whispered with the echoes of fading life. But then, from the depths of ancient lore, arose the Keepers – stewards of nature, guardians of balance, and wielders of an ancient power.\n\nWith wisdom as old as the hills, the Keepers toiled tirelessly, weaving spells of restoration and renewal to heal the wounds of the land. Through their efforts, the park blossomed once more, its rivers running clear, its meadows ablaze with wildflowers, its woodlands alive with the rustle of leaves, and its gardens bursting with colour.\n\nBut as the seasons turned and the winds whispered their secrets, the Keepers knew that their work here was done. With a final nod to the lands they had tended so lovingly, they departed, leaving behind a legacy of beauty and harmony.\n\nYet, as the sun sets on one chapter, so too does it rise on another. For now, Bryngarw Park calls upon a new generation of stewards – protectors who will walk its paths, marvel at its gardens, and safeguard its wild places.\n\nSo, will you heed the call? Will you become the protectors Bryngarw Park needs?\n\nAfter you complete this trail, you will officially be recognised as a Spring Meadow Master!\n\nBefore we begin, I need to quickly talk to the responsible adult(s)...`,

The first screen will be for very young children and then each additional screen will get more complex who knows, maybe I'll even tell you something you didn't know before.  Please just read out what you think is appropriate for your group.\n\nOn the next screen is a map.  Find the red pin and head towards it.\n`,
