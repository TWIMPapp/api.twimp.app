But today, I come to you not just as a dunnock, but as a storyteller from a time long past, when this park was not the lush haven you see before you.

Once upon a time, Bryngarw Park was a realm in need of guardianship. Its rivers ran dark with the stains of industry, its meadows marred by neglect, and its woodlands whispered with the echoes of fading life. But then, from the depths of ancient lore, arose the Keepers – stewards of nature, guardians of balance, and wielders of an ancient power.

With wisdom as old as the hills, the Keepers toiled tirelessly, weaving spells of restoration and renewal to heal the wounds of the land. Through their efforts, the park blossomed once more, its rivers running clear, its meadows ablaze with wildflowers, its woodlands alive with the rustle of leaves, and its gardens bursting with colour.

But as the seasons turned and the winds whispered their secrets, the Keepers knew that their work here was done. With a final nod to the lands they had tended so lovingly, they departed, leaving behind a legacy of beauty and harmony.

Yet, as the sun sets on one chapter, so too does it rise on another. For now, Bryngarw Park calls upon a new generation of stewards – protectors who will walk its paths, marvel at its gardens, and safeguard its wild places.

So, will you heed the call? Will you become the protectors Bryngarw Park needs?

After you complete this trail, you will officially be recognised as a Spring River Ranger!

Before we begin, I need to quickly talk to the responsible adult(s)...`,

This is a walk that loops around the wet woodland and river, you will end up back here.   The walk is a little more than half a mile in total.

At each location, I will tell you about something that you should be able to see.  The first screen will be for very young children and then each additional screen will get more complex.  Who knows, maybe I'll even tell you something you didn't know before.  Please just read out what you think is appropriate for your group.

On the next screen is a map.  Find the red pin and head towards it, it's down at the lake.`,
