The story uses many short words in case you would like to use it as a reading opportunity.  \n  \n***  \n## The North Wind and the Sun  \nOnce upon a time, the North Wind was bragging to his friends.  \n*\"I am so strong I can move anything I want\"*, said the North Wind.  \n*\"Sometimes it is better to be gentle than strong\"* replied the Sun.  \n*\"No it isn't!\"* said the North Wind  \n*\"Yes it is!\"*, said the Sun.  \n*\"Prove it!\"* the North Wind said with a cheeky smile.  \n  \n*\"OK, you see that man down there wearing that winter coat? See if you can take it off\"* said the Sun.  \nThe Wind confidently agreed, \"This will be easy!\".  \n  \nSo the Wind blew with all its might, making the trees shake and sending dust and leaves flying. But the more the wind blew, the tighter the man held onto his coat.  \n  \nThen, it was the Sun's turn. It peeked out from behind a cloud and gently warmed the air. The man started feeling warm, too warm, so he took off his coat and found a shady spot to rest.  \n   \nThe Wind was shocked, *\"How did you do that?\"*. *\"Haha, simple. You tried to force him to do what you wanted, I gently gave him the idea to do it himself\"*.  \n***  \n  \nKeep heading to the pond, when you get there we will continue with Matilda's poem.  \n  \n`,
